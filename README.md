## About

This project aims to explore the effects of exploration versus optimization in simple tree games. To play a tree game, a player starts at the root of the tree and choses which node to go to next,
until the player runs out of moves by reaching the end of the tree. Each node can yield a consistent or variable amount of points, but the player is never told what a node will yield until it is selected. 

Using a variety of different tree games, which have different lengths and variance in node scores, players repeatedly play the game to develop an optimal scoring startegy. Once all players have played the game a set
number of times, each player plays their optimal strategy to see who wins.
